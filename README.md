# Analysing CO2 Emission from year 2004 to 2014.

As a part of master course Big Data at university of koblenz and Landau, Koblenz, Germany, This project has been developed by 3 students as below:
1) Mayur Waghela (MayurWaghela@uni-koblenz.de)
2) Jennifer Gerbl (jgerbl@uni-koblenz.de)
3) Jorge Gavilan (jorge@uni-koblenz.de)

The project has been developed using PySpark.

#Preprocessing - The preprocessing of data includes handling the null and duplicates.

The change in CO2 emission between each year and between 2004 and 2014 has been computed. and clustered using K-means of pyspark.ml library.

The visualization of clusters has been done using GeoPandas, which is Geographic plotting library for python.

The documentation of project can be seen under submission folder.
